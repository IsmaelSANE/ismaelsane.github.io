        My name is Ismael SANE. I have a Bachelor degree in project management
        from <a href="https://www.digital-campus.fr/ecole/bordeaux" target="_blank">Digitale Campus</a>
        and I am a self-taught full stack web developer since 2 years now.
        I did <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/bordeaux" target="_blank">Le Wagon Bordeaux</a>
        coding bootcamp and I am a member of both
        <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/" target="_blank">Learn Enough society</a>
        and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/pro/membership" target="_blank">codecademy pro</a>.
        I have done a 6 months internship as a fullstack Ruby webdeveloper junior at
        <a href="https://www.digitaleseiten.de/startseite" target="_blank">Digitale Seiten</a> at Berlin.

        The role of a webdevloper is very interesting to me. Working in the tech
        industry is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs you can do. I
        think tech is the new literacy and coding is one of the most valuable skill you
        can learn in the 21st century.

      <h3>More about myself:</h3>
      <p>
        Learning new things is entirely part of my life.
        I have a good sens of <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes
        both "hard skills" like coding, command lines, and version control, and
        "soft skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages,
        and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.

    <h2>MAIN PROJECTS</h2>
    <p>
      During my learning journey as a web developer I learned all about Ruby,
      SQL, and the Rails application framework. I have developed my front-end
      skills by using advanced CSS patterns - flexbox, CSS grid - and went
      deeper into Javascript and ES6 - I have built this portfolio using
      <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a> framework - I
      know how to work alone but I rather be part of a team and adopt a technical
      workflow.

            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
            Michael is the creator of the

            Michael is also notorious as the founder of

            slightly exaggerated.

            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
            on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
            interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
            interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on
            Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true
            nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code
            from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
